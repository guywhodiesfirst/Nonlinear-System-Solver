# Nonlinear-System-Solver
A program that gives an approximate solution for the system of nonlinear equations. 
User can choose of five equation templates and one of two methods to use - equations can be solved with either secant method or Newthon method.

After that, user enters required accuracy, starting approximation and coefficients of the equations. If solution exists, it will be displayed:
